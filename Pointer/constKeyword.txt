 ********************************** const keyword **************************************
  
   const is a keyword in c language
   const is a qualifier.
   
Qualifier : The keywords which are used to modify the properties of a variable are called type
            qualifiers.There are two types of qualifiers available in C language. They are 
            const,volatile

            1. Const keyword : Constants are also like normal variables But only difference is
                               their values can’t be modified by the program once they are 
                               defined.They refer to fixed values. They are also called as 
                               literals.

            Syntax:const data_type variable_name; (or) const data_type *variable_name;

            2. Volatile keyword : When a variable is defined as volatile the program may not 
                                  change the value of the variable explicitly.But these variable
                                  values might keep on changing without any explicit assignment
                                  by the program These types of qualifiers are called volatile.

            Syntax:volatile data_type variable_name; (or) volatile data_type *variable_name;

e.g.->

main()
{
   const int x=5;
   x++;
   printf("x = %d\n",x);
}
when we run this code this will give an error that you are trying to increment an variable 
which has read only memory.

>>Historical fact : 
                   const was not there in early C, the concept is borrowed from C++.

>>Usage : 
         The keyword or qualifier const can be applied to any declaration statements , including
         those of structures, unions, enumerated types or typedef names.

>>Applying it to a declaration is called qualifying the declaration.

>> const means that something is not modifiable.

The const keyword :
                   Variables can be declared as constants by using the “const” keyword before
the datatype of the variable. The constant variables can be initialized once only. The default
value of constant variables are zero.
