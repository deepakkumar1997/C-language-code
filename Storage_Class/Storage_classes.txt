******************************* Storage Class ***********************************

There is four types of storage class in C language : 
        CLASS      Keyword
    1. Automatic    auto
    2. Register     register
    3. Static       static
    4. External     extern
Lets first understand where it is required : 

    int x = 5;

So a variable have some properties and we can tell some of them just seeing the variable like :
1. Name of the variable : x
2. Size of the memory block : 4 Bytes as it is an int(Integer) type
3. Type of the content : Integer
 we all know that by default a variable is type of Automatic storage class
4. So variable x is of type Automatic(auto) storage class like it is same as :
    auto int x = 5;
some more properties of a variable
5. Default value stored in variable x is garbage in auto storage class auto garbage is default
   value.
6. Scope of variable should be depend on where it is declared so if we declare it is as global
   then scope of the variable is in whole program means we can use this variable in whole 
   program and if we declare it as local then we can use that variable only in that local block
   not outside the block.
7. Life of a variable again depends on where it is declared in a program and with which storage
   class.

A storage class represents the visibility and a location of a variable. It tells from what part
of code we can access a variable. A storage class in C is used to describe the following things:

            The variable scope.
            The location where the variable will be stored.
            The initialized value of a variable.
            A lifetime of a variable.
            Who can access a variable?
            Thus a storage class is used to represent the information about a variable.

NOTE: A variable is not only associated with a data type, its value but also a storage class.

There are total four types of standard storage classes. The table below represents the storage
classes in C.

Storage class	Purpose
auto	        It is a default storage class.
extern	        It is a global variable.
static	        It is a local variable which is capable of returning a value even when control is transferred to the function call.
register	    It is a variable which is stored inside a Register.
